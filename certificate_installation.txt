The Certification Authority may provide you with a PKCS#7 package (*.p7b) that contains the full chain of certificates required to authenticate your server (the CA-signed server certificate, intermediate certificates, and the CA root certificate). 
This procedure uses Java keytool command to import the certificates from the p7b file into your Java keystore.
