Connect to MySQL database on the host
If you really want to connect the service in the container with a service on the host, you will need to connect the container to the appropriate network.

First, you will need to create a network. Assuming that your local machine has a fixed IP of 192.168.0.1, you should be able to do this with:





docker network create -d bridge --subnet 192.168.0.0/24 --gateway 192.168.0.1 dockernet
You can then:






docker run --name  test-wordpress --net=dockernet -p 8081:80 -d wordpress
