Below is a very simple example of a virtual host configured for SSL. The parts listed in blue are the parts you must add to configure the SSL configuration; they may be spread throughout the file.

<VirtualHost 192.168.0.1:443>
DocumentRoot /var/www/
SSLEngine on
SSLCertificateFile /path/to/your_domain_name.crt
SSLCertificateKeyFile /path/to/your_private.key
SSLCertificateChainFile /path/to/DigiCertCA.crt
</VirtualHost>
Make sure to adjust the file names to match your certificate files.

SSLCertificateFile is your DigiCert certificate file (e.g., your_domain_name.crt).

SSLCertificateKeyFile is the .key file generated when you created the CSR (e.g., your_private.key).

SSLCertificateChainFile is the DigiCert intermediate certificate file (e.g., DigiCertCA.crt)

Note: If the SSLCertificateChainFile directive doesn't work, try using the SSLCACertificateFile directive instead.
