Create a Swap file on

Now we need to create the swap file â€“ Iâ€™m going to create a 4GB file, but you can adjust the values to your needs:

# touch /swap

#  sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap count=14096 bs=1MiB

Now set the permissions:

# sudo chmod 600 /swap

and format the swap file:

# sudo mkswap /swap

To enable the swap file just use:

#  sudo swapon /swap

To make the swap be automatically mounted after reboot, the following command will add it to your fstab config:

#  sudo echo "/swap swap swap sw 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
