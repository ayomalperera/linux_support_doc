Deployment by command line
As Tomcat is set to autodeploy by default, any war file appearing in it's webapps directory will be automatically deployed.

# cp /var/projects/webapp01/dist/webapp01.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/

# chown tomcat:tomcat /usr/share/tomcat/webapps/webapp01.war


Build tc-native requires three components to be installed:

APR library
OpenSSL libraries
Java SE Development Kit (JDK)
In Debian based Linux those dependencies could be installed by something like:

apt-get install libapr1-dev libssl-dev
In rpm based Linux those dependencies could be installed by something like:

yum install apr-devel openssl-devel
